!	.Xkeymap:
!	this file is used with xmodmap to set the keyboard mapping
!	(which keys have which "keysyms" -- you can make any key have 
!	any value). See xmodmap(1) for details.
!
!	This file has comments to explain most of what it being set here.
!	This file is setup to be run through cpp (the C preprocessor) 
!	before being fed to xmodmap. The xdpytype program will determine
!	the proper defines for the display you are using. Typical usage
!	is in your .xession file.
